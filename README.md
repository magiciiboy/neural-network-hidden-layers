# Determining the Number of Hidden Layers

Experiment of Determining the Number of Hidden Layers

I was inspired by the post by Jeff Heaton at https://www.heatonresearch.com/2017/06/01/hidden-layers.html to test what is the best size of hidden layers in a neural network.

I conducted some experiment to extract the insight of performance corresponding with 
variable sizes.
