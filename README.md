# Determining the Number of Hidden Layers

Experiment of Determining the Number of Hidden Layers

I was inspired by the post by Jeff Heaton at https://www.heatonresearch.com/2017/06/01/hidden-layers.html to test what is the best size of hidden layers in a neural network.

I conducted some experiment to extract the insight of performance corresponding with 
variable sizes.

## Experiment #1: ##

Use: 2 hidden layers, prior layer varies, later one has 2/3 size of input + output

## Experiment #2: ##

Use: 2 hidden layers, prior layer has 2/3 size of input + output, later one varies
